This plugin is based upon the mkdocs-plugin-template contributed by Byrne Reese and is modified using its original MIT license . We use the on_config plugin hook to override the extra.homepage setting to match the base URL required by the ComputePods project. We also use the on_env plugin hook to add the extracopyright variable to the Jinja2 Environments globals. This allows us to add the additional Mkdocs plugins we use to maintain the ComputePods documentation. Installation This mkdocs plugin has not (yet) been uploaded to pypi.org . So to install it you need to use: pip install git+https://github.com/computePods/mkdocs-computePods-plugin/ ( see Examples 5. Install a project from VCS ) or pipx install git+https://github.com/computePods/mkdocs-computePods-plugin/ ( see installing from source control ). Using the plugin Activate the plugin in mkdocs.yml : plugins: - search - compute-pods Note: If you have no plugins entry in your config file yet, you'll likely also want to add the search plugin. MkDocs enables it by default if there is no plugins entry set, but now you have to enable it explicitly.
